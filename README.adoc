== 1. Hardware specs and BIOS setup

=== Hardware specs

I decided to buy a budget minipc to build my homelab. Most significant hardware specs are the following:

[source]
----
mac@minipc:~$ lscpu
Architecture:            x86_64
  CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit

smartctl 7.2 2020-12-30 r5155 [x86_64-linux-5.15.0-47-generic] (local build)

=== START OF INFORMATION SECTION ===
Device Model:     AirDisk 128GB SSD
Rotation Rate:    Solid State Device
SATA Version is:  SATA 3.2, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 6.0 Gb/s)
----

For my use case, these hardware specs are perfectly ok regarding cpu and memory. However, only one 128 GBs disk drive is clearly not enough to meet my storage requirements in both capacity and fault-tolerance.

*I describe how to create a software-based homemade NAS storage* based on a pair of 1 TB external USB disks in section 4 (External storage).

=== BIOS setup

BIOS setup for personal pcs are normally set to *boot only when a start button is pressed*. This minipc is a server running 24/7 so in the event of a power outage, I prefer the server to boot automatically when power is restored. This simple config avoids any manual task to restore service.

This kind of low level power management is configured at BIOS level, not in the operating systems. My BIOS is an old American Megatrend one and the setting to change is placed in the *Boot/State After G3* option and must be set to *"Power On"*.

== 2. Linux installation

=== Linux version

Standard stuff here. Downloaded *Ubuntu 22.04 Server* ISO file and flashed in a USB stick. Booted minipc from the USB drive and conducted a common  installation.

Since the minipc final place is in a very uncomfortable place (in the top of a bookshelf), I installed the Ubuntu Server similarly to how desktop machines are installed, reusing my usual keyboard, screen and wifi connection via DHCP.

=== Disk partitioning

Ubuntu graphical installer makes very easy to use LVM. I decided to use the automatic partition table suggested by the installer because it was exactly what I was looking for: a GPT partition table and the / file system mounted under a LVM Volume Group.

[source]
----
mac@minipc:~$ lsblk
NAME                      MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINTS
sda                         8:0    0 119,2G  0 disk
├─sda1                      8:1    0     1G  0 part  /boot/efi
├─sda2                      8:2    0     2G  0 part  /boot
└─sda3                      8:3    0 116,2G  0 part
  └─ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv 253:0    0 116,2G  0 lvm   /
----

Each partition of the disk has a very common and clear goal:
[source]
----
- /boot/efi is where OS-independent bootloader is stored (grub2 in my case)
- /boot is where linux boot-related binaries are stored (mainly kernels and ramdisks).
- / is the root of the file system. It is mounted using LVM.
----

Since / is mounted under a LVM volume group, it's easy to create more logical volumes if required. LVM provides a lot of flexibility to rearrange volumes.

The only modification I did was to change the level of disk space reserved to root in emergency situations. I finally reserved 1% to root and the size of the logical volume perfectly matched the free space of the disk.

=== Network interfaces

A server network configuration is very different to a normal mobile phone/desktop/laptop which normally act as clients so IPs can be dynamic /normally using DHCP).

In a server, the network interfaces has fixed IPs in order be found easily by the clients. Disabling DHCP is mandatory.

My minipc has 2 network interfaces (ethernet and wireless):

[source]
----
mac@minipc:~$ lspci
01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Controller I225-V (rev 01)
02:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 3165 (rev 79)
----

My minipc is placed in the top of a bookshelf, close to the router. I wired minipc to the router via an ethernet cable. To lower the power consumption and to increase security of the minipc I disabled the wireless interface. The wifi interfaces was mainly used to install ubuntu but for 24/7 production server I prefer the stability an ethernet cable.

Ubuntu has plenty options to configure the network interfaces. I finally used netplan and created 2 yaml files:

[source]
----
mac@minipc:~$ ls -a /etc/netplan/
.  ..  ethernet.yaml  .wifi.yaml
----

The config file for the wifi is prefixed by ".", disabling the wireless interface. Both config files can be found https://github.com/macvaz/homelab/tree/main/src/networking[here.]

=== Addition ubuntu packages

Most of the applications running in the minipc are deployed as docker containers. However, these ubuntu packages are required for several reasons:

[source]
----
- docker.io: Docker engine
- docker-compose: Multi-container docker applications
- mdadm: Software RAID management
- wireguard: VPN server
- cockpit: Web interface for linux system administration
- cockpit-file-sharing: Controlling SAMBA and NFS from cockpit
- cockpit-identities: Controlling users and passwords for SAMBA and NFS from cockpit
- rclone: Off-site backup
- minidlna: Export media content via DLNA to smart TV
- ¿tailscale?: VPN server behind cgnat
----
== 3. External storage

This minipc is intended to host 1 on-site fault-tolerant backup for my family media (photos and videos). Consequently, I added two external USB disk drives and create a RAID 1 with them in order to build a homemade NAS server.

In addition, a monthly off-site backup is automatically generated. See Backup section.

Since /dev/sda is used only as main operating system disk drive, this RAID device is used exclusively to support the NAS.
