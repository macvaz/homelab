== 1. Hardware specs and BIOS setup

=== Hardware specs

I decided to buy a budget minipc to build my homelab. Most significant hardware specs are the following:

[source]
----
mac@minipc:~$ lscpu
Architecture:            x86_64
  CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit
  Address sizes:         39 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
  Byte Order:            Little Endian
CPU(s):                  4
  On-line CPU(s) list:   0-3
Vendor ID:               GenuineIntel
  Model name:            Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU J3455 @ 1.50GHz

mac@minipc:~$ more /proc/meminfo
MemTotal:        7982160 kB
----

[source]
----
mac@minipc:~$ sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda
...
Device Model:     AirDisk 128GB SSD
Rotation Rate:    Solid State Device
SATA Version is:  SATA 3.2, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 6.0 Gb/s)
...
----

For my use case, these hardware specs are perfectly ok regarding cpu and memory. However, only one 128 GBs disk drive is clearly not enough to meet my storage requirements in both capacity and fault-tolerance.

*I describe how to create a software-based homemade NAS storage* based on a pair of 1 TB external USB disks in section 3 (External storage).

=== BIOS setup

BIOS setup for personal pcs are normally set to *boot only when a start button is pressed*. This minipc is a server running 24/7 so in the event of a power outage, I prefer the server to boot automatically when power is restored. This simple config avoids any manual task to restore service.

This kind of low level power management is configured at BIOS level, not in the operating systems. My BIOS is an old American Megatrend one and the setting to change is placed in the *Boot/State After G3* option and must be set to *"Power On"*.

== 2. Hypervisor (Proxmox VE) installation

=== Proxmox version

My first build was based on a standard bare-metal **Ubuntu Server 22.04** installation. This setup was perfectly ok for my needs and worked as expected, but I had to create from the scratch several common solutions (like backups for configuration files or automation for installing OS packages). This type of adhoc solutions are a heavy burden to maintain a system in the long run.

Since I ran this setup for almost 9 months, I knew my small minipc was mainly idle for my workloads. At that time I was reading about hardware virtualization and Type I hypervisors (VMMs) and I decided to test Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment).

After downloaded *Proxmox VE 7.3* ISO file, I used *ventoy* to flash it in a USB stick. I booted minipc from the USB drive and conducted a common installation. Installing a hypervisor is not harder than installing a general purpose OS.

Since the minipc final location is in a very uncomfortable place (in the top of a bookshelf), I installed Proxmox VE in a more accessible location using my TV screen and ethernet cable during the process. Configuring Proxmox networking this way simplifies hugely the installation as default values are perfectly ok.

=== OS Disk partitioning

Proxmox graphical installer comes with very good defaults, making disk management very easy. Proxmox is installed only in one disk (OS disk), letting the other disks to create storage pools using the web interface after installation. The final layout of the OS disk looks very professional and at the same time, simple to understand:

[source]
----
mac@minipc:~$ lsblk
sdb
├─sdb1
├─sdb2                       vfat        FAT32                    /boot/efi
└─sdb3                       LVM2_member LVM2
  ├─pve-swap                 swap
  ├─pve-root                 ext4        1.0      PROXMOX_ROOT    /
  ├─pve-data_tmeta
  │ └─pve-data-tpool
  │   └─pve-data
  └─pve-data_tdata
    └─pve-data-tpool
      └─pve-data
----

Each partition or volume group has a common and clear goal:
[source]
----
- /boot/efi is where OS-independent bootloader is stored (grub2 in my case)
- pve-swap is the lvm volume group where Proxmox VE placed the swap space
- pve-root voluge group is where the root file system of Proxmox is placed.
- pve-data_tmeta (metadata) is a LVM-based thin provisioning volume used to store virtual hard disks
- pve-data_tdata (data) is a LVM-based thin provisioning volume used to store virtual hard disks
----

=== Network interfaces

Using Proxmox graphical interface makes network setup quite easy. It detected router physical network and allowed to set up easily a fixed IP address for Proxmox. This IP is visible in all my LAN and is where Proxmox VE GUI can be found.

My minipc has 2 physical network interfaces (ethernet and wireless):

[source]
----
root@proxmox:~$ lspci
01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation Ethernet Controller I225-V (rev 01)
02:00.0 Network controller: Intel Corporation Wireless 3165 (rev 79)
----

My minipc is placed in the top of a bookshelf, close to the router. I wired minipc to the router via an ethernet cable. To lower the power consumption and increase security, wireless interface was not enabled.

=== Additional configuration of proxmox

Since most of the software is going to be installed inside a virtual machine, at the hypervisor level, very few extra packages are required.

The most important thing missing is to set up email relay for automatic alarms. To configure it, just follow Techno Tim's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85ME8i4Ry6A

An extract of the configuration steps is the following:

[source]
----
>> apt instalapt install -y libsasl2-modules mailutils

# Setup credentials in the sasl_passwd file following this format
>> more /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp.gmail.com email:passwd

# Create a hashed version of the file
>> postmap hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
>> chmod 600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

# Paste next configuration in /etc/postfix/main.cf file:
realayhost = smtp.gmail.com:587
smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_security_options =
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/Entrust_Root_Certification_Authority.pem

# Restart postfix
>> postfix reload
----

=== Software distributed from hardware verdors

Some hardware is distributed directly from vendor's website. The UPS monitor should be installed at hypervisor level, not VM level. In the event of a power outage, the complete server, including both hypervisor and all vms, should be shut down when the battery is running out.

Initially I deployed and configured the UPS monitor in a VM but this deployment wes neither reliable (sometimes it didn't detect changed in UPS) nor safe (it only shut down the vm and not the hypervisor)

== 4. Creating a virtual machine on proxmox

Most of the applications running in the minipc are deployed as docker containers. However, these ubuntu packages are required to be installed using apt

[source]
----
- docker.io: Docker engine
- docker-compose: Multi-container docker applications
- rclone: Off-site backup
- minidlna: Export media content via DLNA to smart TV
- ssmpt: Link mail command line tool to ssmpt allowing security emails reach my personal account
- mutt: Command line email client to easily sending email programaticaly from shell scripts
----



== 4. External storage

This minipc is intended to *host 1 on-site fault-tolerant backup for my family media (photos and videos)* so only one disk is not a valid option.

*NAS appliances are a common IT hardware* that provides both large storage capacity and fault-tolerance. Since you have to buy both the chassis and at least 2 disks, NAS appliances are expensive. If you don't mind to pay that cost, I recommend Synology NAS home appliances.

*There are also open-source NAS servers like FreeNAS, OpenMediaVault or Amahi*. However, all of them are based on OS different from Ubuntu (mostly FreeBSD, Debian and Redhat's Linux versions). These servers are distributed as packages of their native OS and also as ISO images. *None of them has official support for Docker* and requires hardware virtualization solutions like Proxmox VE or KVM that I would like to avoid in my minipc.

Note: TrueNAS Core (a Linux-based port of TrueNAS) is a very reasonable option for data storage but hardware requirements are high. Next version of my homelab will be based on TrueNAS Core but it will require to buy a complete new hardware platform.

Consequently, *I decided to build my NAS server from the scratch*. Linux has a lot of projects (mdadm, cockpit, nfs server, samba server, minidlna, etc) that jointly with well-known open-source applications (like syncthing, nextcloud, rclone, etc) allows to create a low-end NAS server easily. Just to be clear, a high-end NAS server requires dedicated hardware but this software-based solution is enough for our storage requirements.

Next I describe the final solution implemented.

=== Create a RAID 1 device

The cheapest solution for creating a redundant storage device for a minipc, is *to connect 2 external USB hard drives and combine them in a redundant multiple disk (md) under a RAID 1 structure*. Since /dev/sda is used only as system drive, this new RAID device (/dev/md0) is exclusively use to support the NAS.

The model and basic specs fo the 2 external USB drives are:

[source]
----
mac@minipc:~$ sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb
...
Model Family:     Toshiba 2.5" HDD MQ04UBF... (USB 3.0)
Device Model:     TOSHIBA MQ04UBF100
...
----

After connecting the 2 devices, a new RAID 1 device can be easily created using *a software RAID controller called mdadm* (multiple device administration). In a linux box, as everyone can imagine, mdadm can be set up in a configuration file (https://github.com/macvaz/homelab/tree/main/src/raid1/mdadm.conf[/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf])

I first created this conf file manually. It's a bit tricky since it requires to recreate the ramdisks in order to mount the disk at boot time. In case you miss this step, your next server reboot will fail. That happens so follow the instructions carefully.

Nowadays, *I would rather recommend to use a frontend (like cockpit) instead of using mdadm direct*. I discovered cockpit after mounting the RAID and I totally fell in love. It's a web-based administration front-end for Linux (similar to Webmin but more updated) that makes administering a Linux box easier (for people like me, software developers, finding all key information in the same web page is gold).

Creating and monitoring a new RAID 1 device with cockpit is quite simple and it doesn't forget to update ramdisks :)

After creating the /dev/md0 device, the block devices of the minipc are the following:
