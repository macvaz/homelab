== 1. Hardware specs and BIOS setup

=== Hardware specs

I decided to buy a budget minipc to build my homelab. Most significant hardware specs are the following:

[source]
----
mac@minipc:~$ lscpu
Architecture:            x86_64
  CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit

=== START OF INFORMATION SECTION ===
Device Model:     AirDisk 128GB SSD
Rotation Rate:    Solid State Device
SATA Version is:  SATA 3.2, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 6.0 Gb/s)
----

For my use case, these hardware specs are perfectly ok regarding cpu and memory. However, only one 128 GBs disk drive is clearly not enough to meet my storage requirements in both capacity and fault-tolerance.

*I describe how to create a software-based homemade NAS storage* based on a pair of 1 TB external USB disks in section 4 (External storage).

=== Bios setup

BIOS setup for personal pcs are normally set to *boot only when a start button is pressed*. This minipc is a server running 24/7 so in the event of a power outage, I prefer the server to boot automatically when power is restored avoiding me to manually pressing the start button.

This kind of low level power management is configured in the BIOS, not in the operating systems. My BIOS is an old American Megatrend one and the setting to change is placed in the *Boot/State After G3* option and must be set to *"Power On"*.

== 2. Linux installation

=== Linux version

ubuntu 22.04 Server

=== Disk partitioning

Only 1 drive partitioned using LVM

== 3. Network interfaces

2 network interfaces
  - nic
  - wifi

== 4. External storage

This minipc is intended to host 1 on-site fault-tolerant backup for my family media (photos and videos). Consequently, I added two extra USB disk drives and create a RAID 1 with them in order to build a homemade NAS server.

In addition, a monthly off-site backup is automatically generated. See Backup section.

Since /dev/sda1 is used only as main operating system disk drive, this RAID device is used exclusively to support the NAS.
